# Automated System for Traffic Lights using .NET Core & Vite React TS
In this application, a traffic light is depicted that regulates traffic flow at four road intersections. The client merely creates a simple display of changing lights for a four-way road.
You seek & peek my configuration at vite.config.ts file in client dir. You can manually check my server configuration tho.
